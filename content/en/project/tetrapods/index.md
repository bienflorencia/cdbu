# A comprehensive database of tetrapod species occurrence records native from Uruguay.  

We hace created a comprehensive database of tetrapod occurrence records native from Uruguay, with the latest taxonomic updates and georeferencing of the collection locations. The dataset provides primary biodiversity data on extant Amphibia, Reptilia, Aves and Mammalia species recorded in Uruguay. The total number of records in the dataset is 69,390, including 680 species (51 amphibians, 444 birds, 117 mammals and 68 reptiles). This is the largest and most geographically and taxonomically comprehensive database of Uruguayan tetrapod species available to date, and it represents the first open repository for the country.

| vernacularName | Common or vernacular name in Uruguay (in Spanish) |
| kingdom | The full scientific name of the kingdom in which the taxon is classified |
| phylum | The full scientific name of the phylum or division in which the taxon is classified |
| class | The full scientific name of the class in which the taxon is classified |
| order | The full scientific name of the order in which the taxon is classified |
| family | The full scientific name of the family in which the taxon is classified |
| countryCode | The standard code for the country in which the Location occurs |
| stateProvince | The name of the next smaller administrative region than country (department) in which the Location occurs |
| verbatimLocality | The original textual description of the place |
| decimalLatitude | The geographic latitude (in decimal degrees) |
| decimalLongitude | The geographic longitude (in decimal degrees) |
| georeferenceSources | A list of maps, gazetteers, or other resources used to georeference the Location |
| georeferencedBy | A person, group, or organization who determined the georeference (spatial representation) for the Location. |
| eventDate | The date when the event was recorded. Format: dd-mm-yyyy |
| year | The four-digit year in which the Event occurred. Format: yyyy |
| month | The ordinal month in which the Event occurred. Format: mm |

| recordedBy | A list (concatenated and separated) of names of people, groups, or organizations responsible for recording the original Occurrence |
| recordNumber | An identifier given to the Occurrence at the time it was recorded. Often serves as a link between field notes and an Occurrence record, such as a specimen collector's number. |
| identifiedBy | A list (concatenated and separated) of names of people, groups, or organizations who assigned the Taxon to the subject |
| iucnStatus | IUCN red list category of the taxon at the Global level |
