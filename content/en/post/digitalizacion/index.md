In the first days of this year we were digitizing specimens from the herbarium of the **National Museum of Natural History of Uruguay**. This is the largest collection of plants in the country, with more than **80,000** herborized specimens, from collections that date from the beginning of 1800 to the present. It gathers the legacy of great botanists of the natural history of our country such as José Arechavaleta, Diego Legrand and Bernardo Rosengurtt, among others.

The work consisted in scanning more than **600** specimens in high quality, using the *HerbScan* system that the museum has, and in the subsequent transcription of the data of each specimen. Data were extracted regarding the species, location and date of collection, and also about who collected the sample and who identified the species. These data are being reviewed and adapted according to international standards for biodiversity data (Darwin Core). They will be added to the more than 10,000 occurrence records of plants that we have gathered with Biodiversidata and are using to answer research questions about the distribution of floras in the national territory. We hope to be able to make all the material available in open format soon and will also seek to continue the work of digitisation.

We would like to thank the Museum, especially Meica Valdivia for their knowledge and kind collaboration, and its director Javier González for his great willingness and openness.
