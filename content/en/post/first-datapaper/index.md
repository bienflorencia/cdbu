Our first paper has been published in the **Biodiversity Data Journal**. It derives from the collaborative work of the team members and sets a milestone in the associationâ€™s history by being the first comprehensive, open-access database of biodiversity records for Uruguay. The Data Paper includes primary biodiversity records of tetrapod species and data descriptors that enrich each organism collection/observation.
