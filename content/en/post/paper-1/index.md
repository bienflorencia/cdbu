**This is the first manuscript we publish with Biodiversidata that uses the data collated by our initiative**. We found that, despite gathering an enormous amount of information on where species are distributed in Uruguay, these data were spatially, taxonomically and spatially biased. Alarmingly, more than 95% of Uruguay's surface remains insufficiently sampled. In order to be able to assess changes in biodiversity and make better evidence-based decisions, it is urgent to increase the data available that can allow us to understand this diversity.

<figcaption align = "center"><b>Fig.4 - Areas for future sampling effort prioritisation. Priority categories for amphibians (a), reptiles (b), birds (c) and mammals (d) were calculated using species accumulation curves (SACs). Scale: Null (i.e., grid-cells where mean slope of the last 10% of SACs was lower or equal to 0.05), ‘Low’ (between 0.05 and 0.25), ‘Medium’ (between 0.25 and 1), ‘High’ (grid-cells where the sampling effort was so low that it was not possible to calculate SACs), and ‘Very High’ (i.e., grid-cells where no records were found). All maps in 25 × 25 km grid-cell resolution. Projection WGS1984.</b></figcaption>
