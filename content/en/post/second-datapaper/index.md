Our second data article has been published in the **Biodiversity Data Journal**. It derives from the collaborative work of the team members, and represents the second complete and open-access database of biodiversity records from Uruguay. The *Data Paper* includes primary biodiversity occurrence records of vascular plant species and a large number of data descriptors that enrich each observation/collection of organisms.
