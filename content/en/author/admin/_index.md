### What is Biodiversidata?

Biodiversidata is a collaborative association of experts with the aim of improving Uruguay’s biodiversity knowledge.
<br>

### Why build a Data Consortium in Uruguay?

The biodiversity patterns in the country remain poorly understood given the severe geographic information gaps. This represents a major challenge in our understanding of the structure of biodiversity and ability to conserve nature.
<br>

### What is the plan?

Collect the maximum possible amount of data from vertebrate, invertebrate and plant species, use it to collaborative generate global impact scientific research and make the data available free and open.
