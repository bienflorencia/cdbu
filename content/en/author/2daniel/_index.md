Daniel's interests touch a variety of questions in evolutionary biology, macroecology and conservation, with a primary focus on understanding Selection Theory, the origin of adaptations, and the global patterns and processes shaping biodiversity and its accelerated declines in the modern world. His work spans both theory and empirical tests of theory, and employs both field and lab approaches. Daniel's primary model systems include the South American lizard genus Liolaemus, and global amphibians and reptiles.
